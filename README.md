FAQ:

Q. So, what's the classic you're remaking?

Tetris. That game in which blocks fall and you complete lines, and ... you get it right?

Q. Hmph! All too familiar. What's new?

Ever observed how blocks in classic tetris just descend through an ocean of nothingness, giving ample time for the player to decide where to place the block?

Q. Yeah. So?

Well, in this game, the blocks which fall are on fire. At different points on the screen, there are sand particles and pieces of gun powder. Sand extinguished the block, while gun powder makes all blocks in the vicinity explode.

Q. Oh! So what are the implications of the explosions?

An explosion reduces the player's score by an amount depending on the amount of damage done to the block's environment. If a participant's score falls below zero, the game is over.

Q. And what about the sand? Do we really need to extinguish a block? Why not just avoid the gun powder?

Well, if a block is on fire for a long time, the size of the game window reduces by the height at which that block is located, making it a much tougher game for you. Plus, if 5 or more blocks are on fire at the same time, you lose. So it is imperative that all your blocks are fire-free.

Q. And what if an extinguished block comes in contact with some more sand?

The block becomes sandy. This means that if a fire block lands on top of the sandy block, it gets extinguished, and both blocks become clean.

Q. Woah! So by that logic, if a clean block comes in contact with gun powder, it becomes all gun-powdery?

Exactly. So when a fire block lands on it, an explosion results.

Q. And all the rules of classic tetris still apply, right?

Definitely

Q. Any more words of wisdom?

An explosion is not always bad. You can use it to clear space. Or you can sacrifice a fire block to gun powder in the hope that the gun powder is replaced by sand next time.
